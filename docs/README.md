## Getting Started
The recommended way to deploy CourseLit on your server is via Ansible. Follow the below mentioned instructions.

```
cd deployment
ansible-playbook install.yml -l <host> -u <host_user>
```

## Running on local
You can run a local instance of CourseLit on your local machine via [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Follow the below mentioned instructions.

1. Cd to the `deployment` folder.
```
cd courselit/deployment
```

2. Create a `.env` file in this directory with the following variables and change the values as per your environment.
```
SITE_URL=http://localhost
MEDIA_FOLDER=~/courselit
MONGO_ROOT_USERNAME=username
MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD=password
DB_CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb://username:password@db
JWT_SECRET=yoursecret
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=2d
```

3. Start the application.

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

4. Visit `http://localhost` in your browser.

## Security
Although, we've done everything in our power to secure the application by following the best practices, we hope you understand that no one can guarantee that it's the most secure implementation out there and it will always stay secure.

Please audit the environment files, docker-compose files and other configurations properly as per your company's security standards. If you've discovered a security vulnerability, consider fixing the issue and submitting a PR.

Use the application at your own risk. People who have worked on this project will not be responsible for any sort of damage that happens to you by using the application.
