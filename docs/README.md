# Introduction
Hi there! Are you an educator looking for a way to start your own online teaching website or business? Have you been to the sites which let you start your own online classes but charge a lot or take a lot commission but you don't want to give away a significant amount of your income to those businesses? Then you are at the right place.

Using CourseLit, which is a content management system (also known as a CMS) specially designed for educators and teachers, you can easily host your own courses on any cheap cloud based server, something like [a $5/month droplet on Digitalocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/) for example. 

CourseLit comes pre-equipped with all the basic tools you'd require to efficiently run and administer your online teaching business. Features include student management, payment processing (via Stripe), customization and analytics (very limited as of now). 

Check out a live example to see what you can build with CourseLit. [Click here](https://codelit.dev).

## Getting Started
The recommended way to deploy CourseLit on your server is via Ansible. Follow the below mentioned instructions.

### Install with SSL
```
ansible-playbook deployment/install.yml -l <host> -u <host_user> --ask-become-pass -e 'ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3'
```

### Install without SSL
```
ansible-playbook deployment/install-without-ssl.yml -l <host> -u <host_user> --ask-become-pass -e 'ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3'
```

> Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and 20.04 LTS versions.

## Troubleshooting
If the above Ansible installer fails, retry the operation after deleting the `media folder` from the server which you specified while running the installer. The default location is `~/courselit-data`.

## Running on local
You can run a local instance of CourseLit on your local machine via [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Follow the below mentioned instructions.

1. Cd to the `deployment` folder.
```
cd courselit/deployment
```

2. Create a `.env` file in this directory with the following variables and change the values as per your environment.
```
SITE_URL=http://localhost
MEDIA_FOLDER=~/courselit
MONGO_ROOT_USERNAME=username
MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD=password
DB_CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb://username:password@db
JWT_SECRET=yoursecret
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=2d
```

3. Start the application.

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

4. Visit `http://localhost` in your browser.

### Environment variables.
**SITE_URL**

The public address of the site. Required parameter. No default value.

**MEDIA_FOLDER**

A folder on your host machine while will be mounted as a volume to all the containers. It is required for storing database files, user uploaded files, ssl certificates and everything else. Required parameter. No default value.

**MONGO_ROOT_USERNAME, MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD**

These are required for correctly initializing an admin user in the mongo db instance running inside the container named `db`. Read more about these [here](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo).

**DB_CONNECTION_STRING**

The connection string to a mongodb instance running in the `db` container. Required parameter. The value should be `mongodb://<MONGO_ROOT_USERNAME>:<MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD>@db` where `MONGO_ROOT_USERNAME` and `MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD` are the same variables defined above.

**JWT_SECRET**

A random string to use as a secret to sign the JWT tokens the API generates. Required parameter. No default value.

**JWT_EXPIRES_IN**

The duration after while the generated JWT expires. For more information [check out here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken). Optional parameter. Defaults to `1d`.

**DOMAIN**

The domain name for which the ssl certificate is issued. Optional parameter, only required if using a SSL certificate. No default value.

## Security
Although, we've done everything in our power to secure the application by following the best practices, we hope you understand that no one can guarantee that it's the most secure implementation out there and it will always stay secure.

Please audit the environment files, docker-compose files and other configurations properly as per your company's security standards. If you've discovered a security vulnerability, consider fixing the issue and submitting a PR.

Use the application at your own risk. People who have worked on this project will not be responsible for any sort of damage that happens to you by using the application.
